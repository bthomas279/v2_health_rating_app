# V2 of the Student Health Rating App Project
**IMPORTANT NOTICE: This project is still under development.**

Planned Development
1. Codebase conversion to Python
2. Model optimizations
3. Add Visualizations
4. Deployment

## About 
This repository houses both the server code, and the machine learning model for my student mental health rating system. I found many flaws with my current system, so I decided to change the codebase of the main server from JavaScript to Python. With this change, I shall naturally switch the server environment from Node.js to FastAPI

├──health_dataset.csv               # Original dataset downloaded from Kaggle
├──nomalized_health_dataset.csv     # Normalized dataset containing relevent columns and consistent mental health scoring.
├──quant_health_dataset.csv         # health_dataset.csv but only containing relevent columns and str are now float or int.
├──reduced_health_dataset.csv       # health_dataset.csv but only containing relevent columns.
├──mental_rating_model.pkl          # Binary file of the ml model turned using joblib
├──regression_model.ipynb           # Code for the Random Forest Regressor Model
├──main.py                          # Contains FAST API to build model into API
└──scoring_norm.ipynb               # Houses the code that normalized health_dataset.csv (weights, relevent columns).
